			"paragraph2": "The thinking was, that if it is possible to get a Bitcoin-backed loan over the desired time period, it may be a way to reduce the taxes to be paid. A Bitcoin-backed loan introduces counterparty risk and the risk of liquidation so this is something everybody has to decide for themselves.",
			"paragraph3": "The x-axis shows the loan amount, the left y-axis shows the taxes to pay. The left y-axis is for the lines \"total taxes\", \"interest\" and \"BTC sale taxes\". The right y-axis shows the expenses which is for area charts \"Loan Amount\" and \"BTC sale amount\"."
